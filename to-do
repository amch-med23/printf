This is the To-Do file
-> we need to update the README.md file to look like,
a document file, because this is required to document the function.
-> we must define THE function prototypes first inside the main.h file
-> i categorized the main.h file to contain the functions definition
by category:
		for example: print_int, print_float (are of type /*print number*/)
		this is commented in main.h file.
-> i did include all the required functions prototypes in main.h, but we need to implement them
  one by one as required from the intranet.

-> we need to collaborate relatively in order for us to be scored fully.

->(Important Remarque), all the fucntion that prints something, do that using _putchar()
and after that they return the number of the printed characters.
